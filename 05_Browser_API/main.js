// The window object represents the browser window or tab that contains the web page. It is the global object in the browser environment and provides access to the browser's features and functionality.

// The document object represents the web page itself and provides access to the DOM (Document Object Model) of the web page. It allows you to interact with the elements on the web page, such as adding or removing elements, changing their styles, and handling user input.

// The fetch function is a browser API that allows you to make HTTP requests to fetch data from a server. It returns a promise that resolves to the response from the server, which can then be processed using the then method.

// The fetch function is a powerful tool for fetching data from a server and interacting with APIs. It allows you to make requests to a server and handle the response in a flexible and efficient way.

// The browser API provides a wide range of functionality for interacting with the browser and the web page. By using these APIs, you can build dynamic and interactive web applications that respond to user input and provide a rich user experience.
